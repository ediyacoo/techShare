#Tech Share
    Tech Share is a method that is designed to push us to be active in study, research and present. Itâ€™s a way that every employee can help each other. It's also important to us to keep keen eyes on what's going on around IT, Web, GIS, Design, Thoughts and so on.
    Tech Share is going to follow the weekly meeting.
