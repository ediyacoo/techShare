#Tech Share
Tech Share is a method that is designed to push us to be active in study, research and present. Itâ€™s a way that every employee can help each other. It's also important to us to keep keen eyes on what's going on around IT, Web, GIS, Design, Thoughts and so on.


Tech Share is going to follow the weekly meeting.
## What we share needs some basic criteria:
* MUST share your thinking of the use case for us (geo spatial, etc.)
* Make YOUR OWN PPT (or other way) presentation to share your Tech Share.
* Try to make your Tech Share interesting. It is not a training session to learn the details.
* MUST have a demo with your Tech Share

## How to select the topic:
* Something comes with new ideas, concepts, new approach to solve new/old problems.
* Preferably something interesting that you newly learned.
* You MUST make sure the content's quality and depth to fit the team well. 
* ASK AROUND before preparing to make sure it's a good topic.

## How to present 
* Control the presentation within 30min.
* The PPT SHOULD be in English.
* Focusing on important factors. Speed up and smooth your talking.
* Give audience a complete story. Here is an example:
  - Why this topic? 
  - What is that?
  - How to apply it for us?
* The next two speakers should give some comments or ask some questions.

## After the Present
You MUST share your topic material in time, here is the guideline:
* Put your materials in \\dory\share\techshare, Named as TopicName-YourName-MMDDYYYY
